                My name is Boi Thi Giang or you can call me Tammy. I am from Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam, I have been living in San Francisco for 7 years.  I like to take picture and this is my Instagram link for the pictures that I took <a href="https://www.instagram.com/xiaphin_/">Xiaphin.</a>.  In my freetime I like to listen to music, draw and talk with my friends on the phone.I also like to learn new things to develop my knowledge and be a better version of myself. I also have a part-time job at a boba shop called YiFang. I have been working there since 2020 and I love my job so much.  I am a student in SFSU and my major is Visual Communication. This is my first semester in SFSU after transferring from CCSF. SFSU is a great school, with a very modern building and classroom. Professors and everyone in here are very supportive. I like the school a lot! Especially for all the trees and flowers we have in the school, a very big gym that I have never seen before and a lot of big buildings in a school. This picture was taken when I went to play badminton with my sisiter, I am a newbie in badminton but I am very excited everytime I play it!

            <h4> She is a very popular singer in Vietnam that has been working in the Vietnamese Showbiz for more than 20 years. I found inspiration by the way she act and for over 20 years she have no scandal, also her music just made me want to start working and thinking more and more idea. I like to listen to her music while working on my project, so that I can think more and be more active. I admire the most about her music, how she delivery the feeling of the music through her voice that touched so many people.</h4>

            <h4>Kulzsc is an artist that I followed so long ago before he even started his career, when he still was an international student in France and posted his work for fun. His style of drawing really inspirited me to study Graphic Design. Even though it seems very simple but it can show the feeling and the heart that an artist put in. I support every single of his work included (book, calendar, shirt or a keychain). I admire the most about his drawing and the effort he put in  all of his work.</h4>

            <h4>This is a company from China that is very popular this few years especially in Asia, people getting crazy about their products. They sell blind box of the character that made by their company, they have been inspired me a lot about how details their products can be and how they match the color so well together. Also the idea of blind box bringing to the customer the curious and nervous feeling. Everything work so well together so the company get popular so quick in this few year. But the fact, they actually have been around since 2010, they worked so hard to get here today, so that they can open a lot of store all over the world. I admire the most about how their idea came up and the way they give each character different personality so that everyone can find their own character from their products.</h4>
